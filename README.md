## Project description
This project, on behalf of the CVD-COVID-UK consortium, investigates UK antipsychotic medication prescribing trends and mortality in people with dementia. We used time series analyses to compare prescribing trends over a five year period, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also used time series analyses to look at all-cause, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease mortality over the same period.
