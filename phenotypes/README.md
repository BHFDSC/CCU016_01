Files:

This file contains International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) and Read version 2 (Read V2) codes to define dementia and its subtypes (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia and dementia with Lewy Bodies), myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke.

2. Appendix_2_drug_codes.xlsx
This file contains the Read V2 drug codes used in this project to identify benzodiazepine and antipsychotic drugs. It outlines which antipsychotic medications are 'first generation' and 'second generation' and highlights alternative indications for these drugs (instead of treatment of psychosis or behavioural symptoms).

3 Appendix_3_causes_of_death.xls

This is the same system that was developed by the Office of National Statistics (see https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatistics/leadingcausesofdeathinenglandandwalesrevised2016) and is used for reporting mortality statistics in England and Wales, UK.
